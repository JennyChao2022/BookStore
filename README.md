## This is the Capstone project, MYLINE Bokstore

The MYLINE Book Store app was designed for the user to manage their book repository online, there are many online bookstore such as Amazon, online bookshops etc,they were designed for purchase, the difference of this capstone project is the focus is to manage your collection for your favourite. 
Therefore, when you sign in the page and you will be able to either register or login into from the Home page, once you successfully login, you will be able to see there has three tabs involved, Add book, Books and About Us.

Add product is the section, you can add your preference into the collection. Once you add in the books, you can check your collections on the Books page, there will including the Name of the book, author, description, price and the picture of the book you added. For the Books you have added, you are able to update and delete the book if you want to make any changes.  

Whats more, the purpose of create this website is to apply the techniqucal skills that I’ve  learnt during the course and further improve practical skills. the purpose of an online bookshop is to provide a convenient and accessible platform for customers to browse and make their own collection of books, while offering a wider selection, competitive pricing, and valuable information to help customers make informed decisions.
